# Experimentation in our design system…

Our platform is comprised of several modules, each of which has a unique set of requirements and use cases. What may work in 9 scenarios might work in the tenth. Simply put, we don't have a fixed "one size fits all" solution for our challenges. We need a way to explore and experiment with our platform while still being able to rely on a core set of components and patterns. Yet, knowing how and when to evolve an existing component or interaction pattern can often be unclear. To solve this, a process for exploration and experimentation will be implemented: **Utilization, Adaptation, then Creation.**

Our design system is similar to a living organism - in a state of flux and constantly adapting to it's surroundings.

## Utilize -&gt; Adapt -&gt; Create

**Utilization** of Starling components allows us to leverage existing solutions for common design problems and needs. With our design system, we built strong foundations of existing UI elements and interaction patterns that we can use, and reuse, with little overhead and the least amount of friction. Using these elements supports creating a consistent experience across modules requiring users to have to do less cognitive work to learn new interactions.

**Adaptation** of an component or pattern is an opportunity to refine and improve all current use cases. When an existing design or behavior doesn’t fully solve a problem, we can make adjustments to an element to accommodate the needs and have those changes propagate throughout the modules and platform.

**Creation** of new UI components or interaction patterns is sometimes needed when the parts of our design system don’t solve a specific problem for our users. We try, whenever possible, to adhere to utilization and adaptation of our system, but recognize that in order to provide a great experience, new artifacts are sometimes needed to solve a problem. By going through this cycle, we can ensure that creation of a new element is beneficial to our system and our users.
