**BETA** - this tag should be used if you are experimenting with completely new components for the UI Kit, or proposing a new change to existing components.

**Do** use the BETA tag when:

* Experimenting with a completely new color palette
* Adding a google map component, when there are no current google map components already in the UI Kit

**Do not** use the BETA tag when:

* Adjusting the padding in an existing symbol to fit with the rest of our components.
