**UPDATE** - this tag should be used when you are fixing or updating an existing component that is already part of the UI Kit.

**Do** use the UPDATE tag when:

* Changing the padding within or around buttons
* Fixing the way an icon behaves when the symbol is stretched to avoid distorting it

**Do not** use the UPDATE tag when:

* Adding a _new_ type of button
