## Commenting on Branches {#commenting-on-branches}

We have several different communication channels in use at ACL (slack, email, invision, etc.). With so many options to discuss new ideas, it is easy for the conversations to fragment and valuable feedback missed. 

Ideally, commenting should be kept as close to the thing be commented on as possible. For UI Kit changes, the closest communication “channel” is the commenting system within abstract. For example, annotations can be placed directly on designs by clicking on the Files tab in Abstract, clicking on a specific file and then clicking on the associated page/symbol. 

This isn’t a hard and fast rule - If it makes more sense to discuss a branch in slack or in invision,  then that should be done. But the name of the branch should be referenced, to help find that feedback later on. 

*_Please note that while abstract has a web based browser, you need an abstract account to view and comment using the browser._
