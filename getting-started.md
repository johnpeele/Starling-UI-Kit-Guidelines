# Getting Started

Let's get the basics in place first - Sketch and Abstract...

1. Install [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/).
2. Install [mandatory Sketch plugins](/sketch-plugins.md#sketch-plugins-mandatory). Go ahead and install the [recommended ones](/sketch-plugins.md#sketch-plugins-optional) since you are feeling extra awesome now.
3. Install [Abstract](https://www.goabstract.com/).

### Consume \(Use\)

To get up and running designing with the Starling UI Kit, follow these instructions:

1. Create your New Project in Abstract \(_**insert animated gif here...**_\)
2. Link the UI Kit Library to your new project \(_**insert animated gif here...**_\)
   1. In the `Master` branch of your new project, navigate to the `Files` tab
   2. Select `Link Library...` in the `Add File` dropdown menu \(_**insert animated gif here...**_\)
   3. In the modal window, select the `Starling Design System` project in the left column
   4. Then select the `Starling UI Kit.sketch` file in the right column
   5. Click the `Link Library` button
3. The UI Kit will now be available to your entire project! Welcome to the future.
4. Now create your working branch

\*\*\***TODO\*\*\***

1. **CREATE A SKETCH TEMPLATE FROM THE 'NEW PROJECT TEMPLATE'**
2. **FIGURE OUT HOW TO START A NEW PROJECT FROM THE TEMPLATE AND LINK THE UI KIT LIBRARY TO IT**


### Contribute \(Make Better\)

If you wish to contribute to the UI Kit by updating/improving an existing component or by experimenting with a brand new component, follow these instructions:

1. In Abstract, open the [`Starling Design System`](https://share.goabstract.com/2a3f637c-1f60-47a1-887e-dbd002f44b18) project from the Projects screen.
2. Mash the `New Branch` button to create your new working branch. **NOTE: **Abstract will NOT let you work in the `Master` branch or any other branch that you do not own yourself. So any new work must start in a new branch.
3. Give your branch a descriptive, but concise, name using one the [standard branch prefixes.](/abstract-guidelines-and-best-practices.md#abstract-name)
4. Get to work yo! Design your heart out. [Commit your work often](/abstract-guidelines-and-best-practices.md#abstract-commit) to Abstract so that you have a thorough history. A solid commit history will be a lifesaver if you ever need to revert back to an earlier state of your design and start over.
5. When you are finished, [update the status of your branch](/abstract-guidelines-and-best-practices.md#abstract-status) and ask another designer\(s\) to review your work and provide feedback. Slack is a great place for this type of collaboration.
6. After you and your design buddies have had their say and all work is complete, merge your working branch back into `Master` so that the rest of the team can revel in your awesomeness.
