# Getting Started

Getting the UI Kit integrated into your design workflow is relatively simple.The first step is preparing your environment, which only has to be done once.

## Preparing your Environment

1. Install [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) - Ensure you have Sketch installed on your computer and that it is up to date with the latest publically released version.
2. Install [Abstract](https://www.goabstract.com/) - The UI Kit is stored in the UX design team's shared repository, which is managed by Abstract. Ensure you have Abstract installed on your computer and that you are a part of the ACL organization in Abstract.
   _**Note:** licenses and access to the above software should be arranged during your onboarding, if not please ask a senior member of the UX team._
3. Once you have Abstract installed, ensure that you have the [Starling Design System](https://share.goabstract.com/2a3f637c-1f60-47a1-887e-dbd002f44b18) project downloaded and sync'd.
4. The UI Kit depends on a few vital Sketch plugins to function properly. The **mandatory plugins** are broken into 2 categories:
   1. Mandatory for **consuming \(using\)** the UI Kit:
      1. [Relabel Button](https://github.com/kenmoore/sketch-relabel-button) - Quickly change the label for a button and update dimensions without affecting padding.
      2. [Craft](https://www.invisionapp.com/craft) - We will use Craft, for the time being, for layer and text styles, but we are currently evaluating it’s future usage with the UI Kit.
      3. [Stark](http://www.getstark.co/) - Easily apply color blindness filters to your designs and check contrast between 2 colors.
         _**Note:** Feel free to use any contrast checker. The requirement here is that you use some kind of contrast tool._
   2. Mandatory for **contributing to** the UI Kit
      1. [Relabel Button](https://github.com/kenmoore/sketch-relabel-button) - Same as above...
      2. [Symbol Organizer](https://github.com/sonburn/symbol-organizer) - This is used to automatically organize all the symbols in the UI Kit. This should be run as part of your commit process when updating the UI Kit.
      3. [Artboard Manager](https://github.com/bomberstudios/artboard-manager) - This is used to automatically preserver the order and spacing between artboards in order to match the Table of Contents in the UI Kit.

It's best to install **all of the above** since these are the minimum required plugins and programs for using, and contributing to, the UI Kit. We've also included suggestions for other plugins that will help you design under the [Sketch Plugins](/sketch-plugins.md) section.

Once you have access to abstract and installed the above plugins, you're ready to start [using the UI Kit](/using-the-ui-kit.md).
