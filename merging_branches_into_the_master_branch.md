## Merging Branches into the Master Branch {#merging-branches-into-the-master-branch}

Once a branch is merged into the master branch, all symbols will become available to the entire UX design team. Any changed symbols will be updated in all existing mockups. So it’s very important to ensure any changes merged to the master branch are:

Accepted by the rest of the UX team

Are built and designed properly to work in all states

Are in ACL-UI, or will shortly be in ACL-UI. What is the development plan?

To make sure the branch meets all of the above, after you’ve resolved the UX team’s feedback, change the status of your branch to **Ready for Review** and one of the lead designers will take a final look at your branch. Once they give the okay, you can merge your branch with master. 

In some cases, using Abstract’s default merging action might not be the best approach. If you aren’t sure of the best way to merge your changes, let a lead designer know.
