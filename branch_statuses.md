## Branch Statuses {#branch-statuses}

Using Abstract’s built in status control is a great way to communicate to the rest of the team the status of your branch. 

When adding to the UI Kit, this is how they should be used:

**Work in Progress -** Set this status when you are actively working on your branch and you don’t need any feedback on your work from the rest of the team. 

**Open for Feedback -** Set this status when you are done your initial build process and you’d like to get feedback from the rest of the team on your work. 

**Ready for Review -** When you’ve resolved the feedback on your branch and you’re ready to merge it back to the master UI Kit, use this status. Lead designers should pay special attention to branches in this status and ensure that nothing in them will cause issues with the other items in the UI Kit.
