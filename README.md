# Starling UI Kit Guidelines {#starling-ui-kit-guidelines}

The Starling UI Kit provides designers with a consistent collection of standard components that are part of ACL-UI, the shared component library that provides the frontend experience for ACL's customers. Using the UI Kit will help you kickstart your designs quickly, ensure that your designs are implemented consistently and help to provide a unifed user experience across the entire ACL GRC system. 

The UI Kit is not meant to limit your designs - you will see that a large majority of components in ACL's GRC system are not part of the kit. The UI Kit is aimed at providing you a stable of simple components to build upon and expand over time. In fact, you - as part of ACL's UX Team - control how much, and how, the UI Kit grows. All UX designers should feel empowered to propose new components, or modify existing ones - follow the guidelines outlined in this document to ensure your changes make it into the shared UI Kit.
