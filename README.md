# Starling UI Kit Guidelines {#starling-ui-kit-guidelines}

Everything about the Starling UI Kit is crafted so our designers spend less time chasing down the latest component versions, creating and re-creating our system components, and more time focussing on user experience, iteration, and building the best versions of our products that we can. All in the interest of consistency and efficiency.

These guidelines are meant to help us all stay on the same page as we consume \(use\), contribute to \(make better\), and collaborate on \(talk and share\) the UI Kit. Notice that we capitalize "UI Kit" on purpose -- because it is a proper and critical piece in our design system puzzle. The guidelines are also serving as our "quality assurance team", ensuring a consistent product design environment by which our customers can experience our products.

This is a living document, meant to grow and flex as we do. Nothing is chiseled in stone and everything is available to improvement and iteration -- just like our products. So feel free to make suggestions and contribute.

### Consuming

We will consume the UI Kit through a combination of Sketch Libraries and the New Project Template.

### Contributing

We will contribute to the UI Kit through a combination of Abstract and a thoughtful branching and peer review strategy.

### Collaborating

We will collaborate on the UI Kit using our existing methods of collaboration - InVision, Freehand \(InVision\), Paper, and Slack.
