# Starling UI Kit Guidelines {#starling-ui-kit-guidelines}

`.markdown-section p:first-of-type {  
  font-size: 21px;  
  line-height: 33px;  
}`

Plugins

**Mandatory**

Craft - We will use Craft, for the time being, but we are currently evaluating itâ€™s future usage with the UI Kit.

Relabel Button - Quickly change the label for a button and update dimensions without affecting padding.

Stark - Easily apply color blindness filters to your designs and check contrast between 2 colors. _** or some other contrast test tool **_

Artboard Manager - Because moving Artboards manually is _so_ 2016

Symbol Organizer - We use this plugin to keep symbol insanity to a minimum in the Starling UI Kit .sketch file

**Optional, but highly recommended**

Sketch Runner - A very, very useful command palette for Sketch.

Rename It - Effectively naming your layers is crucial when working within a team. This plugin helps you to quickly batch rename layers using simple regex methods.
