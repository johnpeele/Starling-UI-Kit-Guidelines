# Starling UI Kit Guidelines {#starling-ui-kit-guidelines}

Everything about the Starling UI Kit is crafted so our designers spend less time chasing down the latest component versions, creating and re-creating our system components, and more time focussing on user experience, iteration, and building the best versions of our products that we can. All in the interest of consistency and efficiency.

These guidelines are meant to help us all stay on the same page as we consume \(use\), contribute to \(make better\), and collaborate on \(talk and share\) the UI Kit. Notice that we capitalize "UI Kit" on purpose -- because it is a proper and critical piece in our design system puzzle. The guidelines are also serving as our "quality assurance team", ensuring a consistent product design environment by which our customers can experience our products.

This is a living document, meant to grow and flex as we do. Nothing is chiseled in stone and everything is available to improvement and iteration -- just like our products. So feel free to make suggestions and contribute.

### Consuming

> We will consume the UI Kit through a combination of Sketch Libraries and the New Project Template.

### Contributing

> We will contribute to the UI Kit through a combination of Abstract and a thoughtful branching and peer review strategy.

### Collaborating

> We will collaborate on the UI Kit using our existing methods of collaboration - InVision, Freehand \(InVision\), Paper, and Slack.

# Starling UI Kit Guidelines {#starling-ui-kit-guidelines}

The Starling UI Kit provides designers with a consistent collection of standard components that are part of ACL-UI, the shared component library that provides the frontend experience for ACL's customers. Using the UI Kit will help you kickstart your designs quickly, ensure that your designs are implemented consistently and help to provide a unifed user experience across the entire ACL GRC system. 

The UI Kit is not meant to limit your designs - you will see that a large majority of components in ACL's GRC system are not part of the kit. The UI Kit is aimed at providing you a stable of simple components to build upon and expand over time. In fact, you - as part of ACL's UX Team - control how much, and how, the UI Kit grows. All UX designers should feel empowered to propose new components, or modify existing ones - follow the guidelines outlined in this document to ensure your changes make it into the shared UI Kit.
