# Sketch Guidelines & Best Practices

## Name your files consistenly {#name-your-files-consistenly}

\(Even though Abstract negates the need for versioning info in our file names, we still need a nice flexible naming pattern here\)

ProjectName-ComponentName.sketch

ComputedFields-FormulaBuilder.sketch

## Label layers in a meaningful way {#label-layers-in-a-meaningful-way}

How many layers does your typical Sketch file contain that are named “Rectangle 2 Copy 5” or “Type something”? And how often did you struggle to find a certain layer in a cluttered artboard because they were basically all named the same? Do yourself and your colleagues a favor and clean up your layers.

## Organize your artboards {#organize-your-artboards}

Because Sketch exports artboards nicely into files or pushes them directly into our prototyping platform, [InVision](https://acl.invisionapp.com), it’s a very good idea to keep their naming consistent, transparent and in a sequential order.

Using horizontal rows to group related views together with a sequential naming pattern is one way to accomplish this. The designer group should decide this together…

The [Artboard Manager](#) plugin will take care of this for us 😃
