# Sketch Plugins

We have identified a set of mandatory and optional plugins that will make working with the UI Kit much more enjoyable.

## **Mandatory** {#sketch-plugins-mandatory}

[Craft](https://www.invisionapp.com/craft)  
We will use Craft, for the time being, but we are currently evaluating itâ€™s future usage with the UI Kit.

[Relabel Button](https://github.com/kenmoore/sketch-relabel-button)  
Quickly change the label for a button and update dimensions without affecting padding.

[Stark](http://www.getstark.co/)  
Easily apply color blindness filters to your designs and check contrast between 2 colors.  
_**\* Note: **Feel free to use any contrast checker. The requirement here is that you use some kind of contrast tool._

[Artboard Manager](https://github.com/bomberstudios/artboard-manager)  
Because moving Artboards manually is **so 2016.** This plugin keeps your artboards neatly arranged in columns and rows. Rearranging is simply as dragging artboards to a new position and the plugin will snap all other artboards into their new position.

[Symbol Organizer](https://github.com/sonburn/symbol-organizer)  
We use this plugin to keep symbol insanity to a minimum in the Starling UI Kit `.sketch` file

## **Optional, but highly recommended** {#sketch-plugins-optional}

[Sketch Runner](http://sketchrunner.com/)  
A very, very useful command palette for Sketch.

[Rename It](http://rodi01.github.io/RenameIt/)  
Effectively naming your layers is crucial when working within a team. This plugin helps you to quickly batch rename layers using simple regex methods.

## **Symbol Organizer Settings** {#sketch-plugins-symbol-organizer}

The plugin has 2 commands:

1. Configure Symbol Organizer \(performed only once\)
2. Run Symbol Organizer \(performed regularly as needed and is required before merging branches back to `Master)`

**Each designer will need to perform the following steps, but only once!**

1. Run the configuration command `Plugins > Symbol Organizer > Configure Symbol Organizer`
2. Enter the following settings
3. Click `Organize`. This will configure **and** run the plugin for the first time
